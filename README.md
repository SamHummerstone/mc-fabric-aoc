Minecraft Server using Fabric for the All Of Create modpack. Running on the old laptop

Due to how curseforge works currently, the download of any extra server folders (`mods` or `resourcepacks`) should be done manually and copied into the `server` folder, where it will be copied post-setup.

Dump it all in git and into the image for now. Later on, the mods can be loaded into a volume at runtime.
